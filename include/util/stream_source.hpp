///
/// class CInputStreamSource encapsulates details of how we supply applications
/// with input data through sets of command-line options, and permits code to
/// work with a standard API for accepting input data from the command-line.
///
/// This class offers many variants for accepting and managing input data.
/// Currently supported modes are:
///
///  - Supply a single argument for an input stream of data
///  - Supply an argument indicating a manifest file (a file whose contents
///    list a set of files, one per line; comment lines preceded by '#' will be
///    skipped
///  - Supply an argument indicating an input search path, with or without a
///    search mask, defining the files to be processed
///
/// Once instantiated, this class supports the ability to iterate a set of
/// input streams using the code metaphor:
///
/// \code
///     const CArgs& args = GetArgs();
///     for (CInputStreamSource source(args);  source;  ++source) {
///         CNcbiIstream& istr = *source;
///         ...
///     }
/// \endcode
///
/// Streams are checked for error conditions at the start (badbit or
/// failbit before being returned from the iterator) and end (badbit
/// after use, prior to iterating to the next stream),
/// throwing an exception in such case. The former handles cases of files
/// which don't exist, and the latter handles cases of disk read errors
/// without preventing operations line getline (which sets failbit
/// on reading the last line of input, with a terminator).
