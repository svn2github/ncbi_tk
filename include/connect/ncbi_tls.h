/** Setup a TLS (Transport Layer Security) provider library to support SSL
 *  in ncbi_socket.h[pp].
 *
 * Currently we support mbedTLS and GNUTLS as the providers.  This call selects
 * the library, which is the default, or which is requested via the registry
 * (aka .ini file), or through the process environment (takes precedence over
 * the registry):
 *
 * [CONN]
 * USESSL={1,0,MBEDTLS,GNUTLS}
 *
 * CONN_USESSL={1,0,MBEDTLS,GNUTLS}
 *
 * "Off", "No", "False", case-insensitively, are also accepted for "0"; and
 * "On", "Yes", "True" -- for "1".
 *
 * If the provider is not present in the build, "0" is assumed.  "1" selects
 * the default provider as currently configured within the toolkit.  With "0",
 * SSL will not be availbale for sockets, and any secure session will fail.
 *
 * @note GNUTLS is only available as an external 3-rd party library, and must
 * be so configured --with-gnutls at the configuration stage of the build.
 * mbedTLS can also be used as an external installation, but the toolkit has
 * an embedded private copy of the library, which can be used transparently
 * without any additional dependencies.  That embedded copy will be used as
 * the default, if no other providers are explicitly present.
